It's always great to see new analytic tools being used to describe everyday activities. Shiny Apps are a great way of allowing readers to interact with data and analysis. Recently, the co-editors of [Biostatistics] (http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/), Jeff Leek and Dimitris Rizopoulos wrote a Shiny app that [lets you examine the recent review times for manuscripts.](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/Biostatistics_Review_Times/). This way, you can see the up-to-date "review survival time" data to get an idea of how long your manuscript will take to review. Very cool idea!
